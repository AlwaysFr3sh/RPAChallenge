# RPA Challenge

Hello, this is my attempt at the Robotic Process Automation challenge found here:

http://www.rpachallenge.com

I am using python (and probably selenium)

# FYI

The challenge file, that can be downloaded from the site needs to be .xls instead of .xlsx for this to work

also, downloading the file (and in this case converting it to xls) could be automated, but won't be in this case

### TODO

Refactor, make it look pretty

find a way to reliably select the correct element

make it faster, it's pretty slow right now (and it doesn't work!!!)
